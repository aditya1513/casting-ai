**14:00 ENHANCEMENT**
- [ ] Motion Graphics Designer: START animation library
- [ ] Iconography Designer: START icon system
- [ ] Data Visualization Designer: START chart components

**TARGET:** Core system complete, enhancements begin

## Day 5 (Friday) - Quality & Polish
**09:00**
- [ ] All agents: Address accessibility feedback
- [ ] Component Library Specialist: Finalize component documentation
- [ ] Dark Mode Specialist: OLED optimization pass

**14:00 REVIEW**
- [ ] CDO Review: Component showcase
- [ ] Accessibility sign-off
- [ ] Performance validation

**TARGET:** Production-ready design system v1.0

## Critical Success Factors

### Must-Have by EOW1:
✅ 100+ design tokens defined
✅ 25 core components built
✅ Dark mode fully supported
✅ Mobile-responsive patterns
✅ WCAG AAA compliance
✅ Mumbai market aesthetic integrated

### Parallel Work Optimization:
- Days 1-2: 3 agents working in parallel (foundation)
- Day 3: 5 agents working in parallel (building)
- Day 4-5: 8-11 agents working in parallel (full capacity)

### Bottleneck Prevention:
1. Visual Systems Architect must deliver tokens by Day 2 noon
2. Component Library must have sharable components by Day 3 noon
3. Accessibility feedback must be actionable, not blocking
4. No agent should wait more than 4 hours for dependencies

### Communication Protocol:
- 09:00: Daily standup (15 min max)
- 14:00: Dependency handoff check
- 17:00: Progress update in Slack
- Blockers escalated immediately to CDO

## Risk Management

**High Risk Items:**
- Token architecture delays (blocks everything)
- Component Library bottleneck (blocks UI)
- Accessibility issues found late (requires rework)

**Mitigation:**
- Parallel work where possible
- Early accessibility involvement
- 2x daily sync points
- CDO available for immediate escalation
