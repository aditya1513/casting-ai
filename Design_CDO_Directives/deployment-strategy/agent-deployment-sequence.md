# Design Agent Deployment Sequence
**CDO Approved: January 2025**

## Critical Path Analysis

### PHASE 1: Foundation (0-48 hours) ⚡ CRITICAL PATH
These agents MUST start immediately and work in parallel:

| Agent | Priority | Dependencies | Deliverables | Timeline |
|-------|----------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| **Visual Systems Architect** | P0 | None | Color tokens, spacing scale, elevation system | 48hrs |
| **Layout Grid Engineer** | P0 | None | 8/12/16 column grid, breakpoints, container specs | 48hrs |
| **Typography Designer** | P0 | None | Type scale, font families, line heights | 48hrs |

**Parallel Capacity:** All 3 can work simultaneously
**Bottleneck Risk:** These are blockers for ALL subsequent work

### PHASE 2: Component Infrastructure (48-72 hours)
Start immediately when Phase 1 delivers initial tokens:

| Agent | Priority | Dependencies | Deliverables | Timeline |
|-------|----------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| **Component Library Specialist** | P0 | Visual tokens, Grid, Typography | 25 core components | 24hrs |
| **Dark Mode Specialist** | P0 | Color tokens | Dark theme variants, OLED optimization | 24hrs |

**Parallel Capacity:** Both can work simultaneously
**Bottleneck Risk:** Component Library blocks UI implementation

### PHASE 3: Specialized Systems (72-96 hours)
Requires base components and tokens:

| Agent | Priority | Dependencies | Deliverables | Timeline |
|-------|----------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| **Interaction Designer** | P1 | Components | Micro-interactions, state transitions | 24hrs |
| **Mobile Experience Designer** | P1 | Grid, Components | Mobile patterns, gesture library | 24hrs |
| **Accessibility Specialist** | P1 | All Phase 1 & 2 | WCAG AAA audit, remediation | 24hrs |

**Parallel Capacity:** All 3 can work simultaneously
**Quality Gate:** Accessibility must approve before production

### PHASE 4: Enhancement (96-120 hours)
Polish and specialized features:

| Agent | Priority | Dependencies | Deliverables | Timeline |
|-------|----------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| **Motion Graphics Designer** | P2 | Interactions | Animation library, transitions | 24hrs |
| **Iconography Designer** | P2 | Visual tokens | Icon system (100+ icons) | 24hrs |
| **Data Visualization Designer** | P2 | Color, Typography | Chart components, dashboards | 24hrs |

**Parallel Capacity:** All 3 can work simultaneously
**Note:** Can begin earlier if resources available

                          └──> Accessibility

Accessibility Specialist ──> [Quality Gate for All]
```

## Coordination Rules

1. **No agent starts without dependencies met**
2. **Phase 1 agents have ZERO dependencies - START IMMEDIATELY**
3. **Daily 15-min sync at phase transitions**
4. **Accessibility has veto power on any deliverable**
5. **Component Library is the critical path bottleneck**

## Risk Mitigation

- **If Visual Systems delayed:** All Phase 2+ blocked
- **If Component Library delayed:** UI implementation blocked
- **If Accessibility finds issues:** Rework required

## Success Metrics

- Phase 1 complete: 48 hours ✓
- Phase 2 complete: 72 hours ✓
- Phase 3 complete: 96 hours ✓
- Phase 4 complete: 120 hours ✓
- Zero blocking dependencies
- 100% accessibility compliance
