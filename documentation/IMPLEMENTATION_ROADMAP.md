---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Immediate Next Steps (Today)**

### **Decision Point: What to Start With?**

**Option A: Start with Infrastructure (Recommended)**
- Build landing page and authentication
- Get user acquisition and retention foundation
- Then add AI features to retained users

**Option B: Start with AI Core** 
- Build conversational interface first
- Risk: No user acquisition or business model
- May create impressive demo but no sustainable growth

**Option C: Parallel Development**
- Split focus between infrastructure and AI
- Risk: Neither gets full attention, longer timeline

### **Recommended Approach:**
**Start with Phase 0A (Landing + Auth)** - Get the foundation right, then the AI features will have maximum impact on actual users who can pay and provide feedback.

---

**This roadmap ensures we build a complete, sustainable product that transforms Mumbai OTT casting from day one of launch, rather than just an impressive tech demo.**
