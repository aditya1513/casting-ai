‚Ä¢ Vicky Kaushal (35) - Strong emotional range, proven with traumatic roles

Rajkummar has the most experience with PTSD-type roles (Omerta, Trapped). Should I check his availability first?"

Priya: "Yes, and also check if he's worked with Director Anurag Kashyap before"

AI: "Great thinking! Checking Rajkummar + Anurag collaboration history...

‚úÖ YES! They worked together on:

‚Ä¢ Previously connected through similar film circles

**So that** I can complete my entire casting workflow without leaving the chat

**Complete Workflow Example:**
```
Priya: "Starting casting for new Netflix series - 'Mumbai Nights'"
[Uploads script]

AI: "Exciting! Mumbai Nights - I've analyzed your script. It's a crime thriller with strong characters:

üé≠ KEY ROLES IDENTIFIED:
‚Ä¢ INSPECTOR RAVI (Male, 35-40) - Lead investigator, needs intensity
‚Ä¢ PRIYA JOURNALIST (Female, 30-35) - Sharp, fearless reporter
‚Ä¢ DON MALIK (Male, 45-50) - Sophisticated antagonist
‚Ä¢ CONSTABLE ROHIT (Male, 25-30) - Ravi's partner, comic relief

Let's start with your lead - Inspector Ravi. Based on the character, I'm thinking method actors with cop experience. Thoughts?"

Priya: "Yes, someone like Saif in Sacred Games but younger"

AI: "Perfect reference! Saif's intensity + sophistication but younger. Here are ideal matches:

üéØ TOP RECOMMENDATIONS:
‚Ä¢ Vikrant Massey (36) - Similar intensity, proven in crime roles
‚Ä¢ Pratik Gandhi (43) - Great dramatic range, sophisticated appeal  
‚Ä¢ Tahir Raj Bhasin (35) - Strong screen presence, can handle cop roles

All three have that intelligent, brooding quality. Vikrant has more cop experience, Pratik brings sophistication, Tahir has the action capability. Who should we start with?"

Priya: "Let's go with Vikrant first, then Pratik as backup"

AI: "Excellent choices! 

‚úÖ INSPECTOR RAVI SHORTLIST:
1. Vikrant Massey (Primary)
2. Pratik Gandhi (Backup)

I'll check their availability for your December shooting schedule. 

Now for Priya the journalist - thinking sharp, fearless women who can handle crime thriller intensity. Radhika Apte types but maybe someone fresh?"

Priya: "Yes, someone who can match Vikrant's intensity"

AI: "Great chemistry consideration! For matching Vikrant's intensity:

‚Ä¢ Shweta Tripathi - Proven intense performer, great opposite Vikrant
‚Ä¢ Sobhita Dhulipala - Strong screen presence, thriller experience
‚Ä¢ Sanya Malhotra - Versatile, can handle intense roles

Shweta and Vikrant have great on-screen chemistry (Mirzapur connection). Should I prioritize her?"

Priya: "Perfect! Add her to the list. What about the antagonist?"

üé≠ ANTAGONIST OPTIONS:
‚Ä¢ Nawazuddin Siddiqui - Master of complex villains
‚Ä¢ Kay Kay Menon - Sophisticated intensity
‚Ä¢ Ronit Roy - Corporate villain expertise

Nawazuddin would bring incredible depth to Don Malik. Budget might be higher but worth it for this character. Thoughts?"

Priya: "Budget is flexible for the right actor. Lock Nawazuddin as first choice"

AI: "Excellent! Your shortlist is taking great shape:

üìã MUMBAI NIGHTS - FINAL SHORTLIST:
‚úÖ Inspector Ravi: Vikrant Massey (Primary), Pratik Gandhi (Backup)
‚úÖ Journalist Priya: Shweta Tripathi (Primary)  
‚úÖ Don Malik: Nawazuddin Siddiqui (Primary)

#### **User Story 7.2: Collaborative Team Decision Making**
**As Meera (Producer)**  
**I want** to review and approve casting decisions through conversation  
**So that** I can quickly provide executive oversight without complex reports

**Conversation Example:**
```
AI: "Hi Meera! Priya has finalized the shortlist for Mumbai Nights. Here's the executive summary:

üìà CASTING OVERVIEW:
‚Ä¢ Total estimated budget: ‚Çπ45L for main cast (within ‚Çπ50L limit)
‚Ä¢ Timeline: All actors available for December shoot
‚Ä¢ Risk: Low - all proven performers
‚Ä¢ Chemistry: Strong potential (Vikrant-Shweta proven pairing)

üé≠ MAIN CAST:
‚Ä¢ Inspector Ravi: Vikrant Massey (‚Çπ15L per episode)
‚Ä¢ Journalist Priya: Shweta Tripathi (‚Çπ8L per episode)
‚Ä¢ Don Malik: Nawazuddin Siddiqui (‚Çπ20L per episode)

Any concerns or changes needed before we proceed to negotiations?"

Meera: "Nawazuddin seems expensive. Any alternatives?"

AI: "Understandable budget concern! Here are alternatives with similar impact:

üí∞ COST-EFFECTIVE OPTIONS:
‚Ä¢ Kay Kay Menon: ‚Çπ12L per episode (40% savings)
‚Ä¢ Ronit Roy: ‚Çπ10L per episode (50% savings)
‚Ä¢ Jaideep Ahlawat: ‚Çπ15L per episode (25% savings)

All are strong antagonists. Kay Kay has the most similar sophisticated menace. This change would bring total budget to ‚Çπ35L, giving you ‚Çπ15L buffer.

However, Nawazuddin's star power could significantly boost viewership - potentially worth the premium. Your call on budget vs star value?"

Meera: "Let's try Kay Kay first. If he's not available, we'll reconsider Nawazuddin"

AI: "Smart approach! Updated casting strategy:

üéØ REVISED PLAN:
‚Ä¢ Try Kay Kay Menon first (‚Çπ12L budget)
‚Ä¢ Keep Nawazuddin as backup (if Kay Kay unavailable)
‚Ä¢ Total budget: ‚Çπ35L with Kay Kay, ‚Çπ45L with Nawazuddin

I'll have Priya reach out to Kay Kay's team today. You'll know availability within 48 hours. Sound good?"

Meera: "Perfect. Keep me updated on responses."

AI: "Absolutely! I'll send you updates as soon as we hear back from anyone. You'll have full visibility on negotiations and responses."
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Provides executive-level summaries automatically
- ‚úÖ Highlights budget, timeline, and risk factors
- ‚úÖ Responds to producer concerns with alternatives
- ‚úÖ Maintains business focus while being conversational
