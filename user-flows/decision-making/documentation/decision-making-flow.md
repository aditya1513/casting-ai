```
"I'll gather everyone's input:

YOUR CHOICE: [Pending]
RAJ (Director): Prefers Arjun - 'has the intensity we need'

Should I call Karan now or send him the comparison?"
```

```

### Phase 4: Negotiation Support (180-300 seconds)

**AI Intelligence:**
```
"Arjun's asking ₹10L. Based on my data:

- Include promotion commitments
- Highlight director attachment
Success probability: 70%"

4. Quick team call

What's your preference?"
```

#### Step 5.2: Final Alignment
