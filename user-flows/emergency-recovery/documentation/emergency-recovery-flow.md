# Emergency & Recovery User Flow
## When Users Get Lost or Need Urgent Help

### Flow Overview
The emergency/recovery flow provides rapid assistance when users encounter problems, feel lost, or face urgent casting crises. It prioritizes speed, clarity, and stress reduction in high-pressure situations.

## Emergency Scenarios

### Scenario 1: User Lost in Interface
**Triggers:**
- Multiple back navigations
- Circular navigation pattern
- Extended idle time
- Explicit "help" command
- Frustrated voice tone detected

**AI Intervention:**
```
"I notice you might be looking for something specific. 
Let me help! What are you trying to do?

Quick options:
• Go to current project
• Find an actor
• Check today's schedule
• See recent work
• Start fresh"
```

### Scenario 2: Urgent Casting Crisis
**Trigger:** "Emergency! Actor dropped out"

**AI Crisis Response:**
```
"I'm on it! Let's solve this quickly.

Which actor dropped out and from which role?
[Voice input activated for speed]"
```

**Rapid Resolution:**
```
"Got it. Arjun dropped from male lead, shooting Monday.
Here's your action plan:

IMMEDIATE OPTIONS:
1. ✓ Rahul (backup) - Available, calling now...
2. ✓ Vikram - Can adjust schedule
3. ✓ 3 similar actors ready

I'm already:
- Checking their availability
- Preparing urgent contracts
- Alerting your team

What's your priority: Same look or available immediately?"
```

### Scenario 3: Technical Failure
**Trigger:** System error/crash/network issue

**AI Recovery:**
```
"Something went wrong, but don't worry!

✓ Your work is saved (5 mins ago)
✓ Attempting reconnection...
✓ Offline mode activated

You can continue working. I'll sync when connected.
Need anything urgently? I can work offline."
```

### Scenario 4: Deadline Panic
**Trigger:** "I need to submit cast list in 1 hour!"

**AI Speed Mode:**
```
"Deadline mode activated! Let's get this done.

CASTING STATUS:
✓ Lead roles: 2/3 confirmed
⚠ Supporting: 4/8 confirmed
❌ Child actor: Not selected

Here's the fastest path:
1. Auto-select from shortlisted (15 seconds)
2. Quick approve pre-screened (2 minutes)
3. Use successful past cast (instant)

Your choice? [Auto-select] [Quick review] [Past cast]"
```

## Recovery Patterns

### Pattern 1: Context Loss Recovery
**Situation:** User returns after interruption

**AI Context Restoration:**
```
"Welcome back! You were:
- Working on: Mumbai Dreams casting
- Last action: Reviewing Priya's audition
- Pending: 3 decisions needed
- Team waiting: Raj needs male lead decision

Continue where you left off? [Yes] [Show summary] [Start different task]"
```

### Pattern 2: Mistake Recovery
**Situation:** Wrong action taken

**AI Undo Support:**
```
"I noticed you just:
- Rejected all 5 actors
- Deleted the audition schedule
- Sent wrong message to team

Undo this action? [Undo] [Keep] [Modify]

(Don't worry, nothing is permanent until contracts are signed!)"
```

### Pattern 3: Information Overload Recovery
**Situation:** Too many options, user overwhelmed

**AI Simplification:**
```
"Let's simplify this. Too many choices?

Instead of 50 actors, let me show you:
- Top 3 by director preference
- Top 3 by availability
- Top 3 by budget fit

Or just tell me what matters most right now."
```
