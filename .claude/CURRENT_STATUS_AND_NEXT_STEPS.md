## Recommended Action Plan - Next 2 Weeks 🚀

### Day 1-3: Anthropic Integration
```bash
# Setup Anthropic SDK
cd /Users/Aditya/Desktop/casting-ai
npm install @anthropic-ai/sdk

# Create environment variables
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key" >> .env

# Implement basic Claude service
# Focus: Get basic conversational AI working
```

### Day 4-6: Memory Foundation  
```bash
# Setup Redis connection (fix existing issues)
# Implement short-term memory
# Create conversation persistence
# Test memory across chat sessions
```

### Day 7-10: Integration & Testing
```bash  
# Connect chat UI to Claude + Memory
# Implement streaming responses
# Test end-to-end conversation flow
# Performance optimization
```

### Success Metrics (End of Week 2):
- [ ] Working conversational AI with Claude
- [ ] Basic memory preservation across sessions
- [ ] Streaming chat responses
- [ ] <2 second average response time
- [ ] 5+ successful end-to-end conversations

## Technical Implementation Tasks

### 1. Immediate Fixes Needed

**Fix Redis Connection Issues:**
```typescript
// Current issue: Redis authentication errors
// File: src/config/redis.ts - needs debugging
// File: docker-compose.yml - Redis password configuration
```

**Enable Disabled Routes:**  
```typescript
// File: src/server.ts - many routes currently disabled
// Priority: Enable chat routes, talent routes, auth routes
```

**Environment Configuration:**
```bash
# Create comprehensive .env.example
# Setup development vs production configs
# Add Anthropic API credentials
```

### 2. Core Implementation Files to Create

Priority Files to Implement:
├── src/services/anthropic/
│   ├── conversation.service.ts
│   ├── memory-enhanced-prompts.ts
│   └── response-parser.ts
├── src/services/memory/
│   ├── short-term-memory.service.ts

└── src/db/schema/
    ├── conversations.ts
    ├── memory.ts
    └── chat-sessions.ts
```

### 3. Database Schema Updates Needed

```sql
-- Add conversation and memory tables
-- File: src/db/schema/conversations.ts
CREATE TABLE conversations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  project_id UUID REFERENCES projects(id),
  title TEXT,
  messages JSONB,
  memory_context JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE memory_episodes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID,
  content JSONB,
  importance_score FLOAT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  embedding VECTOR(1536) -- for vector similarity
);
```

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team (Immediate - 2 weeks):
- **You (Technical Lead)**: Full-time - Architecture + Implementation  
- **AI Developer** (Recommended hire): Focus on Claude integration + memory system
- **Frontend Developer** (Part-time): Chat UI refinements + real-time features

### Infrastructure Costs (Development):
- **Anthropic API**: ~₹30K/month (development usage)
- **Redis Cloud**: ~₹5K/month (if local Redis issues persist)  
- **Development services**: ~₹10K/month

### Total 2-Week Budget: ~₹90K

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
1. **Redis Connection Issues**: Use Redis Cloud as backup
2. **Anthropic API Rate Limits**: Implement smart caching + model routing
3. **Memory System Complexity**: Start simple, iterate based on usage

### Timeline Risks:
1. **Integration Complexity**: Focus on MVP first, enhance later
2. **Performance Issues**: Implement monitoring from Day 1
3. **Scope Creep**: Strict focus on conversational AI + basic memory

---

## Success Criteria (End of Week 2)

### Must Have:
- [ ] Claude-powered conversational AI working
- [ ] Basic conversation memory (session-based)
- [ ] Chat UI connected to AI backend  
- [ ] Streaming responses implemented
- [ ] Basic error handling and fallbacks

### Nice to Have:
- [ ] Long-term memory storage
- [ ] User preference learning
- [ ] Talent search integration
- [ ] Multi-conversation management

### Go/No-Go Decision Criteria:
- **Go**: Conversational AI responds intelligently to casting queries
- **Go**: Memory preserves context across 3+ message exchanges
- **Go**: UI feels responsive and engaging (<2s response time)
- **No-Go**: If above criteria not met, reassess approach

2. Get Anthropic API key: https://console.anthropic.com/
3. Create basic Claude service file
4. Test simple API call

# Day 1 Afternoon (3-4 hours):  
1. Debug Redis connection issues
2. Create conversation schema
3. Implement basic memory storage
4. Test chat -> Claude -> response flow
