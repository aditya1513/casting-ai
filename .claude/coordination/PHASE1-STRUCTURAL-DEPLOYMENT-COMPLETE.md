- Automated dependency handoffs
- Quality gate monitoring
- Risk mitigation alerts

### Design-First Enforcement
- Frontend development appropriately blocked until design tokens ready
- Component work queued for immediate start after foundation complete
- CDO approval gates enforced at all critical junctions

## ðŸš¨ RISK MONITORING ACTIVE

### High-Impact Risks (Monitored)
1. **Token System Delay**: Could cascade to all components
   - **Status**: ðŸŸ¢ ON TRACK (VSA focused, no distractions)

2. **Grid-Typography Integration**: Must align perfectly
   - **Status**: ðŸŸ¡ MODERATE (coordination meeting scheduled)

3. **CDO Review Bottleneck**: Could delay Phase 2
   - **Status**: ðŸŸ¢ MITIGATED (review scheduled, materials prepared)

### Automated Risk Response
- Delay detection within 15 minutes
- Automatic resource reallocation
- Emergency escalation protocols active
