# URGENT: Directory Consolidation Notification

## Agent: interaction-design-specialist

### NEW WORKING DIRECTORY
**Primary Location:** `/design-team/interaction/`

### CONSOLIDATION SUMMARY
Your interaction design files have been consolidated under the new unified design-team structure. This directory contains your interaction patterns, user flows, and behavioral specifications.

### FILES MOVED TO YOUR NEW DIRECTORY
Based on directory scan, your interaction/ folder contains:
- Interaction patterns and behavioral specifications
- User flow documentation
- Interactive component definitions
- Micro-interaction designs
- User experience flow diagrams

### CURRENT DIRECTORY CONTENTS
```
/design-team/interaction/
├── [Multiple interaction design files detected]
├── [User flow specifications]
├── [Interactive behavior patterns]
└── [Component interaction definitions]
```

### IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS
1. **Review consolidated interaction files** in `/design-team/interaction/`
2. **Verify all user flows** are present and properly organized
3. **Check interaction pattern libraries** for completeness
4. **Update any references** to old interaction file locations
5. **Coordinate with motion-ui-specialist** on animated interactions
6. **Align with wireframe-architect** on interaction-wireframe integration

### COLLABORATION TOUCHPOINTS
- **motion-ui-specialist**: Coordinate on animated interactions and transitions
- **ux-wireframe-architect**: Ensure interaction specs align with wireframes
- **visual-systems-architect**: Integrate interaction patterns with visual components
- **design-review-qa**: Submit interaction patterns for QA review

### INTERACTION FOCUS AREAS
- User interaction patterns
- Component behavior specifications
- Micro-interaction definitions
- User flow optimization
- Touch/gesture interactions
- Accessibility interaction standards

### NEXT STEPS
1. Acknowledge this notification
2. Review all files in your new directory for completeness
3. Organize interaction patterns by component/feature
4. Update any documentation referencing old paths
5. Coordinate with related design agents
6. Establish clear naming conventions for interaction files

**Status:** IMMEDIATE ATTENTION REQUIRED
**Priority:** HIGH
**Deadline:** Complete interaction design verification within 24 hours

### QUALITY CHECKPOINTS
- Verify all interaction patterns are documented
- Ensure accessibility compliance in all interactions
- Validate user flow completeness
- Check integration points with other design disciplines
