# URGENT: Directory Consolidation Notification

## Agent: design-research-analyst

### NEW WORKING DIRECTORY
**Primary Location:** `/design-team/research/`

### CONSOLIDATION SUMMARY
Your design research files have been consolidated under the new unified design-team structure. This directory contains extensive research assets, trends analysis, and implementation guides.

### FILES MOVED TO YOUR NEW DIRECTORY
Based on comprehensive directory scan, your research/ folder contains:
- **Code samples**: gleb-animations.js, uxerflow-patterns-react.tsx
- **Workflow documentation**: screenshot-capture-workflow.md, STANDARD-SCREENSHOT-PROTOCOL.md
- **Component research**: uxerflow-extracted-components.json
- **Implementation guides**: implementation-guide-2025-01-06.md
- **Inspiration assets**: Extensive uxerflow screenshot collection (20+ webp files)
- **Research guides**: recreate-in-figma.md
- **Capture protocols**: screenshot-validation-checklist.json
