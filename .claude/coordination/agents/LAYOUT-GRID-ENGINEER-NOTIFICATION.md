# URGENT: Directory Consolidation Notification

## Agent: layout-grid-engineer

### NEW WORKING DIRECTORY
**Primary Location:** `/design-team/visual-systems/grids/`

### CONSOLIDATION SUMMARY
Your grid system and layout engineering files have been consolidated under the visual-systems architecture. You now work as a specialized engineer within the visual systems team, focusing specifically on grid systems and layout frameworks.

### WORKING RELATIONSHIP
- **Parent Directory**: `/design-team/visual-systems/` (managed by visual-systems-architect)
- **Your Workspace**: `/design-team/visual-systems/grids/`
- **Reporting Structure**: You work closely with the visual-systems-architect

### FILES TO BE ORGANIZED IN YOUR NEW DIRECTORY
- Grid system specifications and documentation
- Layout framework definitions
- Responsive grid breakpoints
- Grid component libraries
- Layout engineering guidelines
- Grid performance optimization docs

### IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS
1. **Coordinate with visual-systems-architect** on directory structure setup
2. **Create your grids/ subdirectory** within visual-systems
3. **Move all grid-related files** to your new workspace
4. **Establish grid system documentation**
5. **Integrate with overall visual system architecture**

### SUGGESTED DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
