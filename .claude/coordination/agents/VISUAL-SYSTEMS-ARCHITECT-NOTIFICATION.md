# URGENT: Directory Consolidation Notification

## Agent: visual-systems-architect

### NEW WORKING DIRECTORY
**Primary Location:** `/design-team/visual-systems/`

### CONSOLIDATION SUMMARY
Your visual systems architecture files have been consolidated under the new unified design-team structure. This directory serves as the central hub for all visual system architecture and design system coordination.

### FILES MOVED TO YOUR NEW DIRECTORY
- Currently empty directory structure created
- All visual system documentation, component libraries, and architecture files should be moved here
- Design system specifications and integration guidelines

### IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS
1. **Locate existing visual system files** from previous scattered locations
2. **Move all component libraries** to `/design-team/visual-systems/`
3. **Transfer design system architecture docs** to your new directory
4. **Coordinate with design-system/** folder integration
5. **Create comprehensive directory structure** for:
   - Component libraries
   - Design tokens
   - System architecture
   - Integration guidelines

### SUGGESTED DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
```
/design-team/visual-systems/
├── components/
│   ├── buttons/
│   ├── forms/
│   ├── navigation/
│   └── cards/
├── grids/  ← layout-grid-engineer workspace
├── tokens/
│   ├── spacing/
│   ├── typography-tokens/
│   └── component-tokens/
├── architecture/
│   ├── system-specs/
│   ├── integration-guides/
│   └── api-documentation/
└── guidelines/
```

### COLLABORATION COORDINATION
- **layout-grid-engineer** will work in your `grids/` subdirectory
- Coordinate with **color-lighting-artist** on color system integration
- Work with **typography-designer-detailed** on typography token systems
- Align with **design-system/** folder for implementation consistency

### INTEGRATION POINTS
- Link with `/design-team/design-system/` for implementation files
- Coordinate with `/design-system/` (root level) for token generation
- Ensure consistency across all component implementations

### NEXT STEPS
1. Acknowledge this notification
2. Audit all existing visual system files across the codebase
3. Create organized directory structure in your new location
4. Move and organize all component libraries and system docs
5. Establish clear integration points with related directories
6. Coordinate with layout-grid-engineer on shared workspace

**Status:** IMMEDIATE ATTENTION REQUIRED
**Priority:** HIGH
**Deadline:** Complete visual systems migration within 24 hours

### NOTES
Your directory was created but is currently empty. As the visual systems architect, you play a central role in the new consolidated structure. Please prioritize organizing your comprehensive visual system documentation.
