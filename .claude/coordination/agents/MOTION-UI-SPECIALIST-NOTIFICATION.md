# URGENT: Directory Consolidation Notification

## Agent: motion-ui-specialist

### NEW WORKING DIRECTORY
**Primary Location:** `/design-team/motion/`

### CONSOLIDATION SUMMARY
Your motion and animation design files have been consolidated under the new unified design-team structure. This directory contains your animation specifications, motion systems, and UI transition designs.

### FILES MOVED TO YOUR NEW DIRECTORY
Based on directory scan, your motion/ folder contains:
- Animation specifications and motion design files
- UI transition definitions
- Motion system guidelines
- Easing curve specifications
- Performance-optimized animation assets

### CURRENT DIRECTORY CONTENTS
```
/design-team/motion/
├── [Multiple motion design files detected]
├── [Animation specifications]
├── [Transition libraries]
├── [Easing and timing definitions]
├── [Motion system documentation]
└── [Performance guidelines]
```

### IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS
1. **Review consolidated motion files** in `/design-team/motion/`
2. **Verify all animation specifications** are present and properly organized
3. **Check motion system guidelines** for completeness
4. **Update any references** to old motion file locations
5. **Coordinate with interaction-design-specialist** on interactive animations
6. **Validate performance optimization** documentation

### COLLABORATION TOUCHPOINTS
- **interaction-design-specialist**: Coordinate on micro-interactions and animated behaviors
- **color-lighting-artist**: Integrate lighting effects with motion design
- **visual-systems-architect**: Ensure motion aligns with overall visual system
- **design-review-qa**: Submit motion specifications for performance review

### MOTION FOCUS AREAS
- UI transitions and animations
- Micro-interaction animations
- Loading states and progress indicators
- Gesture-based animations
- Performance-optimized motion
- Accessibility-compliant animations

### PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS
- Ensure all animations meet 60fps standards
- Validate reduced-motion accessibility compliance
- Review animation performance impact
- Optimize for mobile and low-power devices

### NEXT STEPS
1. Acknowledge this notification
2. Review all files in your new directory for completeness
3. Organize motion patterns by interaction type
4. Update any code references to old animation paths
5. Coordinate with interaction and visual system teams
6. Establish motion design system consistency

**Status:** IMMEDIATE ATTENTION REQUIRED
**Priority:** HIGH
**Deadline:** Complete motion design verification within 24 hours

### QUALITY CHECKPOINTS
- Verify all animation specifications are documented
- Ensure accessibility compliance (reduced motion support)
- Validate performance optimization guidelines
- Check integration with interaction design patterns
