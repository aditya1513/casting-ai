## SERVICE STATUS MATRIX

### CORE SERVICES STATUS âœ…
| Service | Status | Port | Health Check | Performance |
|---------|--------|------|--------------|-------------|
| **Frontend** | ðŸŸ¢ HEALTHY | 3001 | âœ… Responsive | Excellent |
| **Backend API** | ðŸŸ¢ HEALTHY | 5002 | âœ… Stable | Excellent |
| **Python AI** | ðŸŸ¢ HEALTHY | 8002 | âœ… Active | Working |
| **PostgreSQL** | ðŸŸ¢ HEALTHY | 5432 | âœ… Connected | Stable |
| **Redis** | ðŸŸ¢ HEALTHY | 6379 | âœ… Connected | Fast |

### BACKGROUND PROCESSES MONITORED âœ…
- **Active Background Services**: 14 services running
- **Frontend Dev Server**: Stable on port 3001
- **Backend Nodemon**: Stable with auto-restart
- **AI Service**: Multiple instances active
- **Database Pool**: Connected and initialized

## CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED & RESOLVED

### ðŸ”´ MAJOR ISSUE: Database Connectivity Failure
**Problem**: Backend continuously crashing due to missing PostgreSQL user 'castmatch_user'
**Impact**: Complete backend service failure, API unavailability
**Root Cause**: Database user permissions not properly configured

**Resolution Applied**:
1. Created PostgreSQL user: `castmatch_user`
2. Granted database creation privileges
3. Assigned all database permissions
4. Restarted backend with proper credentials
5. Verified database connection pool initialization

**Result**: âœ… Backend fully operational, database queries successful

### ðŸŸ¡ MINOR ISSUE: Port Conflicts
**Problem**: Multiple backend instances attempting port 5002 binding
**Resolution**: Killed conflicting processes, started single stable instance
**Result**: âœ… Clean port assignment, no conflicts
