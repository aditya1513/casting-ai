# Orchestration Summary

## Critical Path Focus - Week 1-2
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Infrastructure stabilization (Redis, containers)
2. **Day 2**: Anthropic Claude API integration
3. **Day 5**: End-to-end chat flow testing
4. **Day 7**: Memory system operational
5. **Day 14**: Full conversational AI platform

## Dependency Chain Status
- 🔴 **BLOCKED**: AI services (waiting for infrastructure)
- 🟡 **WAITING**: Frontend integration (waiting for APIs)
- 🟢 **ACTIVE**: Infrastructure, Backend, Design systems
- ⚪ **STANDBY**: Testing, Integration workflows

## Quality Gates Enforced
- ✅ Infrastructure Stability Gate
- ⏳ AI Integration Gate (in progress)
- ⏳ End-to-End Functionality Gate (pending)

## Next 24 Hour Priorities
1. **DevOps**: Fix Redis connection issues 
2. **Backend**: Install Anthropic SDK, implement basic Claude service
3. **AI/ML**: Prepare memory system architecture
4. **Frontend**: Optimize chat UI for AI integration
5. **QA**: Establish Week 1-2 quality checkpoints
