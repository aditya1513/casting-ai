## 🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (NEXT 4 HOURS)

### Critical Path Tasks

#### 1. DevOps Infrastructure (BLOCKER)
```bash
# Start Docker Desktop first
# Then execute:
cd /Users/Aditya/Desktop/casting-ai
docker-compose up -d postgres redis
```

#### 2. Backend API Developer
```bash
# Install Anthropic SDK
npm install @anthropic-ai/sdk

# Create .env with API key
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here" >> .env
```

#### 3. AI/ML Developer
```python
# Begin memory architecture design
# File: python-ai-service/app/services/memory_manager.py
# Design 3-layer memory model
```

#### 4. Frontend UI Developer
```typescript
// Prepare streaming handlers
// File: frontend/app/chat/page.tsx
// Add SSE/WebSocket support
```

## 🎬 COORDINATION PROTOCOLS

### Daily Schedule
- **09:00** - Morning sync (automated standup)
- **13:00** - Progress check (dependency verification)
- **18:00** - Evening review (next day planning)

### Monitoring
- **Every 2 hours** - Automated health checks
- **Every 4 hours** - Progress tracking
- **Every 6 hours** - Blocker escalation

### Quality Gates
- **Day 3** - Infrastructure stability gate
- **Day 5** - Claude API functionality gate
- **Day 7** - End-to-end flow gate
- **Day 14** - Production readiness gate

---

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

### What's Working
- ✅ Frontend chat UI structure exists
- ✅ Database schema defined
- ✅ Project structure organized
- ✅ Design system in progress

### What's Blocked
- ❌ Docker/Redis preventing all AI work
- ❌ No Anthropic integration yet
- ❌ Memory system not implemented
- ❌ No streaming responses

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Infrastructure**: Use cloud services if local fails
2. **API Limits**: Implement caching and rate limiting
3. **Timeline**: Focus on MVP, enhance later
4. **Resources**: Parallel work on independent tasks

## 📞 ESCALATION MATRIX

| Time | Level | Action | Example |
|------|-------|--------|---------|
| 0-2h | Agent-to-Agent | Direct coordination | Share Redis fix |
| 2-6h | Orchestrator | Task redistribution | Reassign blocked work |
| 6h+ | Human | Strategic decision | Scope adjustment |

---

## 🚦 GO/NO-GO DECISION POINTS

### Day 3 Checkpoint
- **GO if**: Infrastructure stable, Claude responding
- **NO-GO if**: Still blocked on Redis/Docker

### Day 7 Checkpoint  
- **GO if**: E2E chat working with memory
- **NO-GO if**: Core functionality incomplete

### Day 14 Checkpoint
- **GO if**: MVP ready for user testing
- **NO-GO if**: Critical features missing
