## üîç CRASH ANALYSIS

### What Was Being Worked On Before Crash
Based on the git history and coordination files, the system was actively working on:

1. **Week 1-2 Implementation Phase** (Days 2-14 of foundation phase)
   - Core chat functionality with Claude AI integration
   - Multi-agent coordination across 16 agents (6 development + 10 design)
   - Infrastructure stabilization and monitoring

2. **Recent Commits** (Last successful work):
   - `be21feb`: Resolved server crashes and stabilized backend
   - `02390e6`: Fixed Prisma P1010 errors, added direct PostgreSQL service
   - `da4351b`: Post-recovery system optimizations
   - Database setup fixes and PostgreSQL authentication adjustments

3. **Active Agent Tasks** (From monitoring logs):
   - DevOps: Docker/Redis infrastructure setup
   - Backend: Anthropic Claude API integration
   - AI/ML: Memory system architecture design
   - Frontend: Chat UI optimization for streaming
   - Design Team: Design tokens and component library

## üö® IMPACT ASSESSMENT

### Services Affected by Crash

| Service | Pre-Crash Status | Post-Crash Status | Recovery Action |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Docker** | Unknown | ‚ùå Not Running | ‚úÖ Restarted successfully |
| **PostgreSQL** | Running | ‚úÖ Running (healthy) | No action needed |
| **Redis** | Connection issues | ‚úÖ Running (healthy) | Container restarted |
| **Backend API** | Development mode | ‚úÖ Running on :5002 | Service restarted |
| **Frontend** | Development mode | ‚úÖ Running on :3001 | Service restarted |
| **Monitoring Scripts** | Active | ‚ùå Stopped | ‚úÖ Restarted agent-monitor.sh |

### Code/File Issues Found

1. **Missing Dependencies**
   - `rate-limiter-flexible` package was not installed initially
   - Resolved by installing the package (found in package.json)

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - `.env` file was missing/corrupted
   - Recreated with all necessary configuration variables
   - Anthropic API key placeholder added (needs real key)

3. **Database Connection**
   - PostgreSQL role "castmatch_user" doesn't exist
   - Non-critical: Service running with alternative connection

4. **TypeScript Compilation**
   - Multiple router type inference errors
   - Non-blocking: Development server running despite warnings
