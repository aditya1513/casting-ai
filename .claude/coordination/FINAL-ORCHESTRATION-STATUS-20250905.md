# CASTMATCH ORCHESTRATION - FINAL STATUS REPORT
**Date**: September 5, 2025, 23:25 IST  
**Mission**: Post-Week 1 System Monitoring & Coordination  
**Status**: MISSION ACCOMPLISHED âœ…

## ORCHESTRATION SUMMARY

### CRITICAL SYSTEM RECOVERY âœ… COMPLETED
The CastMatch system experienced a critical database connectivity failure that was successfully diagnosed and resolved through autonomous orchestration protocols:

**Problem Resolved**: 
- PostgreSQL user `castmatch_user` did not exist
- Backend services continuously crashing on startup
- Database connection failures preventing full system operation

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created proper PostgreSQL user with full permissions
- Restarted backend services with correct credentials  
- Verified database connectivity and connection pooling
- Restored full operational status
