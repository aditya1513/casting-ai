- [ ] Smooth scrolling and infinite loading
- [ ] Reduced motion accessibility compliance

## CONTINUOUS QUALITY ASSURANCE

### Design QA Agent - VETO Authority
**Review Frequency**: Real-time monitoring
**Blocking Power**: Can halt any implementation

#### Consistency Checks
- [ ] Brand guideline adherence verification
- [ ] Component library consistency validation
- [ ] Cross-workflow design pattern alignment
- [ ] Documentation accuracy and completeness

#### Technical Quality Gates
- [ ] WCAG AAA accessibility compliance
- [ ] Color contrast ratios (minimum 7:1)
- [ ] Performance budget adherence
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility validated

## ORCHESTRATOR ESCALATION MATRIX

### AUTO-RESOLUTION (No Human Intervention)
- Minor design inconsistencies
- Performance optimization suggestions
- Accessibility contrast adjustments
- Component documentation updates

### ESCALATION TO DESIGN QA (VETO Power)
- Brand guideline violations
- Major accessibility failures
- Performance budget overruns
- Cross-workflow inconsistencies

### ESCALATION TO HUMAN (Strategic Decisions)
- Fundamental design direction changes
- Technology stack modifications
- Timeline impact >24 hours
- Client requirement conflicts

## CHECKPOINT MONITORING AUTOMATION

### 4-Hour Review Cycle
```bash
# Auto-execute every 4 hours
./monitor-agents.sh design-team-status
./validate-deliverables.sh quality-gates
./generate-status-report.sh chat-ui-progress
```

### Quality Metrics Tracking
- **Design Consistency Score**: Target >95%
- **Accessibility Compliance**: 100% WCAG AAA
- **Performance Budget**: <3s load time maintained
- **Cross-Agent Coordination**: <2 hour response time

## AGENT CAPACITY MANAGEMENT

### Workload Balancing
- Monitor active task count per agent
- Prevent >3 concurrent high-complexity tasks
- Auto-reassign based on specialization and availability
- Track completion velocity for realistic scheduling

### Dependency Chain Optimization
- Block downstream work until upstream approval
- Pre-queue logical next tasks based on completion patterns
- Maintain parallel track coordination
- Prevent circular dependency loops
