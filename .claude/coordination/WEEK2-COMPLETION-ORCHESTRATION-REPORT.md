## 🚨 RISK ASSESSMENT & MITIGATION

### Critical Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| Pinecone integration delay | MEDIUM | HIGH | Use in-memory search as fallback |
| Test coverage target miss | HIGH | MEDIUM | Focus on critical path tests only |
| Frontend streaming bugs | MEDIUM | HIGH | Implement gradual rollout |
| Integration complexity | HIGH | MEDIUM | Prioritize calendar only |
| Resource constraints | LOW | HIGH | Add auto-scaling rules |

### Contingency Plans
1. **If Pinecone fails**: Use PostgreSQL full-text search
2. **If testing lags**: Focus on integration tests over unit tests
3. **If streaming breaks**: Fallback to polling mechanism
4. **If integrations delayed**: Push to Week 3
