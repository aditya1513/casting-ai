## ORCHESTRATION DIRECTIVES

### For All Agents
1. **NEVER** accept tasks from general-purpose agents
2. **ALWAYS** verify task comes from specialized orchestrator
3. **ALWAYS** hand off to another specialized agent
4. **NEVER** skip specialization for speed

### For Development Agents
1. ai-ml-developer leads all AI/ML features
2. backend-api-developer handles all API work
3. frontend-ui-developer owns all UI components
4. No crossover without explicit handoff

### For Quality Agents
1. testing-qa-developer validates all code
2. design-review-qa approves all UI changes
3. Both have VETO power on deployments

## NEXT ORCHESTRATION CHECKPOINT
**Time**: In 4 hours (validate memory system progress)
**Focus**: 
1. Check ai-ml-developer progress on memory implementation
2. Verify backend-api-developer API endpoints
