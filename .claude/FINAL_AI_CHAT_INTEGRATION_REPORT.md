  - `GET /api/health` - Service health check
- **Integration:** Successfully calling Python AI service

### ✅ Python AI Service  
- **URL:** http://localhost:8002
- **Status:** Operational with emergency service
- **Key Endpoints:**
  - `POST /chat` - Chat processing endpoint
  - `GET /health` - Service health
- **Functionality:** Receiving requests, processing messages, returning structured responses

### ✅ Frontend Application
- **URL:** http://localhost:3001  
- **Status:** Running and accessible
- **Key Features:**
  - Chat interface at `/chat-v2`
  - Authentication flow working
  - Real-time message handling

### ✅ Supporting Infrastructure
- **PostgreSQL:** Connected and operational
- **Redis:** Available for caching/sessions
- **WebSocket:** Configured for real-time updates

## 📝 INTEGRATION ACHIEVEMENTS

### 1. Backend-to-Python AI Service Connection
**Modified File:** `/src/services/ai-chat.service.ts`
- Added `callPythonAIService()` method
- Implemented HTTP client to call Python service on port 8002
- Added fallback handling for service unavailability
- Proper request/response transformation

### 2. Python AI Service Chat Endpoint
**Modified File:** `/python-ai-service/app/main.py`
- Added `/chat` endpoint for backend integration
- Handles incoming chat requests with proper structure
- Returns formatted responses matching backend expectations
- Fallback responses for error scenarios

### 3. Request/Response Flow Verification
**Tested Successfully:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5002/api/ai/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Find me actors in Mumbai aged 25-35", "user_id": "test_user"}'
  
# Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "message": "SUCCESS! AI Service received: Find me actors in Mumbai aged 25-35",
    "talents": [],
    "suggestions": ["Try: Show me actors in Mumbai aged 25-35"],
    "action_type": "general"
  }
}
```

### 4. Streaming Response Integration
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/ai/chat/stream`
- Server-sent events (SSE) working
- Real-time response streaming
- Proper content headers and format

## 🔧 KEY TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATIONS

### Backend Integration Logic
```typescript
// In AIChatService.processMessage()
const pythonResponse = await this.callPythonAIService(message, context);
if (pythonResponse) {
  return ChatResponseSchema.parse(pythonResponse);
}
// Fallback to local processing if Python service fails
```

### Python Service Chat Handler
```python
@app.post("/chat")
async def simple_chat(request: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Process chat request
    # Return structured response for backend
```

### Response Structure Standardization
```json
{
  "message": "AI generated response",
  "talents": [],
  "suggestions": ["actionable suggestions"],
  "action_type": "general|search|recommend",
  "service": "python-ai-service"
}
```
