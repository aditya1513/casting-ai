# Prisma P1010 Error - Analysis and Solution

## Error Details
**Error Code**: P1010  
**Message**: `User 'postgres' was denied access on the database 'castmatch_db.public'`

## Root Cause Analysis
After extensive research and testing, the P1010 error occurs when:
1. Prisma tries to access the database with schema-level operations
2. The PostgreSQL user lacks proper schema permissions
3. The connection string doesn't properly specify the schema

## Solutions Attempted

### ✅ What We've Done:
1. **Docker Setup**: Created proper docker-compose with init scripts
2. **Permissions**: Granted ALL privileges to postgres user
3. **Connection String**: Added `?schema=public` parameter
4. **Prisma Config**: Added `directUrl` for direct connections
5. **Database**: Successfully created tables and schema

### ⚠️ Current Status:
- Database is working (28 tables created)
- Direct psql connections work
- Prisma client still throws P1010

## The Real Issue
Based on GitHub issues and Prisma documentation, this appears to be a known issue with Prisma 5.x when:
- Using PostgreSQL with certain permission configurations
- The database user needs explicit schema-level grants
- Running in Docker environments

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Use Different User (Recommended)
Create a dedicated application user instead of using postgres superuser:

```sql
CREATE USER castmatch_user WITH PASSWORD 'castmatch123';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE castmatch_db TO castmatch_user;
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO castmatch_user;
ALTER SCHEMA public OWNER TO castmatch_user;
```

Then update DATABASE_URL:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://castmatch_user:castmatch123@localhost:5432/castmatch_db?schema=public
```

### Option 2: Use Prisma Migrate Reset
```bash
npx prisma migrate reset --force
```

### Option 3: Direct SQL Execution
Since tables are created, bypass Prisma for database operations and use direct SQL or a different ORM like TypeORM or Knex.

### Option 4: Downgrade Prisma
Some users report success with older versions:
```bash
npm install prisma@4.16.2 @prisma/client@4.16.2
```

## Workaround for Development
Since the database structure is correct, you can:
1. Use the existing tables (they're properly created)
2. Write raw SQL queries for database operations
3. Or switch to a different ORM temporarily

## Files Created
- `docker-compose.fixed.yml` - Improved Docker setup
- `docker/postgres/init-permissions.sql` - Auto-permission script
- `scripts/setup-database.sh` - Complete setup automation
- `scripts/fix-prisma-p1010.sh` - Aggressive permission fix

## Next Steps
1. Consider switching to TypeORM or Knex for immediate productivity
2. File a bug report with Prisma team
3. Monitor Prisma GitHub for updates on this issue
