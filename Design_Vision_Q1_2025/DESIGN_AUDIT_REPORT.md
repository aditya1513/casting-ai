   - Basic buttons lacking state variations
   - No loading or skeleton states
   - Missing empty state designs

4. **User Experience Gaps**
   - No onboarding flow sophistication
   - Basic form designs without progressive disclosure
   - Missing contextual help systems
   - No personality or brand expression

5. **Technical Implementation**
   - No design token system
   - Hardcoded values throughout
   - Missing responsive breakpoint system
   - No dark mode optimization

- **Grid System**: Basic flexbox vs. Advanced layout grid

### Priority 2: Experience Gaps (Fix Within 2 Weeks)
- **Onboarding**: None vs. Guided progressive experience
- **Empty States**: Generic messages vs. Illustrated guidance
- **Loading States**: Browser defaults vs. Skeleton screens
- **Error Handling**: Basic alerts vs. Contextual inline validation
- **Accessibility**: WCAG A vs. WCAG AAA compliance

### Priority 3: Polish Gaps (Fix Within 4 Weeks)
- **Micro-animations**: None vs. Purposeful motion system
- **Hover States**: Basic color change vs. Elevated interactions
- **Focus Management**: Browser defaults vs. Custom focus rings
- **Transitions**: Instant vs. Smooth contextual transitions
- **Dark Mode**: Missing vs. OLED-optimized experience
