## INSPIRATION REFERENCE ANALYSIS

### Key Patterns to Implement:

**From uxerflow references:**
1. **Glassmorphic Cards**
   - Backdrop blur: 20px
   - Background: rgba(255,255,255,0.1)
   - Border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.2)
   - Shadow: 0 8px 32px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)

2. **Gradient Overlays**
   - Primary: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%)
   - Secondary: linear-gradient(135deg, #f093fb 0%, #f5576c 100%)
   - Dark mode: Reduced opacity (0.8)

3. **Typography Treatment**
   - Headlines: Bold, high contrast
   - Subheads: Medium, 0.8 opacity
   - Body: Regular, optimized line-height
   - Captions: Small, 0.6 opacity

4. **Interactive Elements**
   - Hover: Elevation change + glow
   - Active: Scale(0.98) + shadow reduction
   - Focus: Ring with offset
   - Disabled: 0.4 opacity
