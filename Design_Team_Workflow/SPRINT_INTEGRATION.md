### Prioritization Framework

#### MoSCoW Method
- **Must Have**: Critical for launch
- **Should Have**: Important but not critical
- **Could Have**: Nice to have
- **Won't Have**: Future consideration

#### Weighted Scoring
```
Score = (User Value × 3) + (Business Value × 2) + (Technical Feasibility × 1)
                                    6
```

### Estimation Techniques

#### Design Points
```
1 point = 4 hours
2 points = 1 day
3 points = 2 days
5 points = 3-4 days
8 points = 1 week
13 points = 1.5 weeks
```

#### Complexity Factors
- New pattern creation: +40%
- Research required: +20%
- Stakeholder reviews: +20%
- Accessibility complexity: +15%
- Multiple platforms: +30%
