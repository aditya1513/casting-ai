# Match Badge Overlap Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem
The match badge was overlapping with card content due to absolute positioning, causing text to be obscured.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. CSS Structure Changes

#### Before (Problematic):
- Match badge was positioned `absolute` relative to the card
- Card header had `padding-right` to try to avoid overlap
- Badge was a sibling element outside the card-header

#### After (Fixed):
- Match badge is now `position: relative` with flexbox positioning
- Card header uses `display: flex` with `justify-content: space-between`
- New `.card-header-left` wrapper contains avatar and card-info
- Badge is now inside the card-header as a flex child

### 2. HTML Structure Changes

#### Before:
```html
<div class="showcase-card">
    <div class="match-badge">98% Match</div>  <!-- Outside header -->
    <div class="card-header">
        <div class="avatar"></div>
        <div class="card-info">...</div>
    </div>
</div>
```

#### After:
```html
<div class="showcase-card">
    <div class="card-header">
        <div class="card-header-left">  <!-- New wrapper -->
            <div class="avatar"></div>
            <div class="card-info">...</div>
        </div>
        <div class="match-badge">98% Match</div>  <!-- Inside header -->
    </div>
</div>
```

### 3. Key CSS Properties Applied

```css
.card-header {
    display: flex;
    align-items: flex-start;
    justify-content: space-between;  /* Pushes badge to the right */
    gap: var(--space-md);
}

.card-header-left {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    flex: 1;  /* Takes available space */
    min-width: 0;  /* Prevents overflow */
}

.match-badge {
    position: relative;  /* Changed from absolute */
    flex-shrink: 0;  /* Prevents badge from shrinking */
    align-self: flex-start;  /* Aligns to top */
}
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **No Overlap**: Badge is part of the flex layout, so it naturally avoids overlapping with content
2. **Responsive**: Works across all screen sizes without special positioning
3. **Maintainable**: Simpler CSS without magic numbers for positioning
4. **Semantic**: HTML structure better reflects the visual relationship
5. **Flexible**: Easy to adjust spacing using gap and padding

## Testing
- Mobile: Badge appears inline with proper spacing
- Tablet: Badge scales appropriately with larger text
- Desktop: Badge maintains position without overlap
