## DESIGN PRINCIPLES (Core 3)

### 1. **Cinematic Excellence**
Every interface element should evoke the premium entertainment experience. Visual hierarchy mirrors film composition techniques, with dramatic lighting effects and sophisticated typography that makes talent profiles feel like movie posters come to life.

**Implementation:**

- Typography that balances English and regional script aesthetics
- Cultural celebration in visual elements without caricature
- Industry-specific iconography and visual metaphors

### 3. **Dark Mode First Architecture**
OLED-optimized design that reduces eye strain and power consumption while creating an immersive, theater-like experience for talent discovery.

**Implementation:**
- True black (#000000) backgrounds for OLED efficiency
- Carefully calibrated contrast ratios (minimum 7:1)
- Ambient lighting adaptation
- Power-conscious animations and transitions
