- Director-talent private conversation threads
- Performance scoring within chat context
- Follow-up action item tracking

**Workflow 5: Contract Negotiation Chat**
- Legal-safe messaging with compliance indicators
- Document sharing and review workflows
- Version control for contract discussions
- Approval chain visualization

**Workflow 6: Project Update Chat**
- Multi-cast group messaging interfaces
- Production announcement broadcasting
- Role-specific information filtering
- Emergency communication prioritization

#### 2. Core Chat Interface Components

**Message Threading System:**
- Primary conversation flow
- Reply threading (max 3 levels deep)
- Context preservation for long conversations
- Thread collapse/expand functionality

**File Sharing Architecture:**
- High-res image portfolio uploads
- Video reel streaming integration
- PDF script and contract handling
- Progress indicators for large file transfers

**User Role Differentiation:**
- Visual hierarchy for talent/director/coordinator
- Permission levels in group conversations
- Status indicators (online/busy/available)
- Role-based feature accessibility

**Mobile-First Responsive Design:**
- Touch-optimized message composition
- Gesture-based navigation patterns
- Thumb-zone optimization for Indian users
- Portrait/landscape mode adaptations

### TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS

#### Performance Requirements:
- Message load time <200ms for conversation history
- Infinite scroll optimization for 1000+ message threads
- Real-time sync indicators across devices
- Offline message queuing architecture

#### Accessibility Standards:
- WCAG AAA compliance for screen readers
- High contrast mode for dark theme (#000000)
- Keyboard navigation for all chat functions
- Voice-to-text integration planning

#### Mumbai Film Industry Context:
- Hindi/English language switching workflows
- Cultural appropriate messaging tone indicators
- Indian mobile device optimization (smaller screens)
- WhatsApp-familiar interaction patterns

### DELIVERABLES (6-Hour Window)

#### Primary Wireframe Outputs:
1. **Chat Interface Wireframes** (design-system/chat-ui/structure/wireframes-v1/)
   - Desktop conversation layouts (1920x1080, 1440x900)
   - Mobile conversation layouts (375x812, 390x844)
   - Tablet conversation layouts (768x1024, 834x1194)
   - All 6 casting workflow variations

2. **Information Architecture Document** (design-system/chat-ui/structure/chat-ia-2025.md)
   - Conversation organization hierarchy
   - Message threading logic and rules
   - Navigation patterns between conversations
   - Search and filtering architecture

3. **User Flow Diagrams** (design-system/chat-ui/structure/user-flows/)
   - Conversation initiation flows
   - File sharing and media workflows  
   - Group chat creation and management
   - Cross-workflow conversation transitions

4. **Component Specification** (design-system/chat-ui/structure/components-spec.md)
   - Message bubble specifications
   - Input field and attachment requirements
   - Header and navigation components
   - Status indicator and notification systems

### COORDINATION PROTOCOL

#### Phase 1 Dependencies:
- **PARALLEL WORK**: Layout Grid Engineer working on 8-point grid system
- **BLOCKING WORK**: Visual design agents wait for wireframe completion
- **QUALITY GATES**: 6-hour checkpoint with design QA review

#### Handoff Requirements:
- **To Layout Engineer**: Spacing and grid alignment specifications
- **To Visual Team**: Component hierarchy and interaction states
- **To Motion Team**: Transition and animation trigger points

### SUCCESS CRITERIA
