## 👥 Design Team Agents

### Active Design Agents:
1. **typography-designer-detailed** - Typography and content design
2. **typography-content-designer** - Typography optimization and microcopy
3. **color-lighting-artist** - Color systems and lighting design
4. **visual-systems-architect** - Design system architecture
5. **interaction-design-specialist** - Interaction and animation design
6. **motion-ui-specialist** - Motion graphics and UI animations
7. **ux-wireframe-architect** - Wireframes and user flows
8. **design-review-qa** - Design quality assurance
9. **design-research-analyst** - Design research and trends
10. **layout-grid-engineer** - Grid systems and layouts
11. **chief-design-officer** - Design leadership and strategy

## 📝 Agent Guidelines

All design agents should now:
1. **Read files from**: `/design-team/[subdirectory]/`
2. **Write outputs to**: `/design-team/[subdirectory]/`
3. **Reference resources**: Use the consolidated paths in all documentation
4. **Collaborate**: Share resources within the unified structure
5. **Version control**: All changes tracked in the consolidated directory

## 🎯 Benefits of Consolidation

- **Centralized Resources**: All design assets in one location
- **Better Collaboration**: Easier cross-agent resource sharing
- **Improved Organization**: Clear categorization by design discipline
- **Simplified Maintenance**: Single source of truth for design files
- **Enhanced Discovery**: Easier to find and reference design resources

## 🔧 Usage Examples

```bash
# Typography agent accessing fonts
/design-team/typography/fonts/

# Motion agent storing animations
/design-team/motion/animations/

# QA agent creating audit reports
/design-team/qa-audits/reports/

# Research agent storing trends
/design-team/research/trends/
```

## 📅 Effective Date

This consolidation is effective immediately as of January 7, 2025. All future design work should use the new structure.
