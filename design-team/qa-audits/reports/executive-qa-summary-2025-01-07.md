## CONCLUSION

CastMatch shows strong design foundation but faces critical quality issues that could severely impact Mumbai market success. The current 74/100 quality score is unacceptable for launch.

**With focused 48-hour effort on P0 issues, we can achieve:**
- 85/100 quality score (minimum viable)
- Legal compliance for accessibility
- Basic cultural readiness
- Acceptable mobile performance

**Without these fixes:**
- Legal liability risk
- 40% market adoption loss
- Negative brand perception
- Competitive disadvantage

**The Design QA Agent strongly recommends:** Conditional soft launch with mandatory P0 fixes completed first.
