## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Key Finding
CastMatch's current design adopts Western tech aesthetics that may feel disconnected from Mumbai's vibrant entertainment industry culture. Significant localization required for authentic market fit.

### Business Impact
- **Market Penetration Risk:** 30-40% reduced adoption without localization
- **User Trust:** Lower credibility in Bollywood circles
- **Competitive Disadvantage:** Local competitors better aligned
- **Revenue Impact:** Potential 25% revenue loss from poor cultural fit
