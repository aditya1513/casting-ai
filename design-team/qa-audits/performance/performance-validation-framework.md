  - sizes attribute properly configured
  - Art direction via <picture>
  - Lazy loading below fold
  
Compression:
  - Quality: 85% for photos
  - Quality: 95% for screenshots
  - PNG optimization via pngquant
  - SVG optimization via SVGO
```

### Code Optimization
```yaml
JavaScript:
  - Tree shaking enabled
  - Code splitting by route
  - Dynamic imports for features
  - Minification and uglification
  - Source maps for debugging only
  
CSS:
  - Critical CSS inline
  - Unused CSS removed
  - PostCSS optimization
  - CSS modules for scoping
  - Minification enabled
  
HTML:

  - Comments removed
  - Whitespace optimized
  - Compression enabled
```

### Caching Strategy
```yaml

  - Images: 1 year cache
  - Fonts: 1 year cache
  - CSS/JS: Versioned, 1 year cache
  
Dynamic Content:
  - HTML: No cache or short (5 min)
  - API: Cache-Control headers
  - User Data: No cache
  
Service Worker:
  - Precache critical assets
  - Runtime caching for API
  - Offline fallback pages
  - Background sync for forms
```

## PERFORMANCE REGRESSION PREVENTION

### Automated Testing
```yaml
CI/CD Pipeline:
  - Lighthouse CI on every PR
  - Bundle size analysis
  - Performance budget checks
  - Visual regression testing
  
Thresholds:
  - Block if FCP regression >10%
  - Block if bundle increase >5%
  - Block if new images >200KB
  - Warn if CSS increase >10KB
```

### Manual Review Gates
```yaml
Design Review:
  - Estimate performance impact
  - Identify optimization opportunities
  - Flag heavy animations
  - Check image sizes
  
Code Review:
  - Verify lazy loading implementation
  - Check for performance anti-patterns
  - Validate caching headers
  - Review third-party scripts
```
