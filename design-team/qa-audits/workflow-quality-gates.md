## Automated Quality Checks

### Design Linting
```javascript
// Figma plugin checks
const designChecks = {
  colorCompliance: checkTokenUsage(),
  textStyles: validateTypography(),
  spacing: checkSpacingSystem(),
  naming: validateLayerNames(),
  components: checkComponentUsage()
};
```

### Accessibility Testing
```javascript
// Automated a11y checks
const a11yChecks = {
  contrast: checkColorContrast(),
  altText: validateImageDescriptions(),
  headings: checkHeadingHierarchy(),
  landmarks: validateARIALandmarks(),
  focus: checkFocusManagement()
};
```

### Performance Testing
```javascript
// Performance validation
const perfChecks = {
  imageSize: validateImageOptimization(),
  fontLoading: checkFontStrategy(),
  cssSize: measureStylesheetSize(),
  jsBundle: checkBundleSize(),
  renderTime: measureRenderPerformance()
};
```
