# CLAUDE BIBLE - CastMatch Project Documentation

## Documentation Rule Established
**Date**: 2025-09-10
**Rule**: Single Bible Document - All Claude updates consolidated here

### Key Principles:
1. **NO NEW MARKDOWN FILES** - Never create separate .md files for different features/components
2. **SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH** - All updates append to CLAUDE-BIBLE.md 
3. **STRUCTURED SECTIONS** - Use clear headings and timestamps
4. **VERSION CONTROL** - Each entry includes date and context
5. **CONSOLIDATION PRIORITY** - Always edit existing content rather than create new files

## Latest Updates (Most Recent First)

### 2025-09-10 - BRUTAL REALITY: What Actually Works vs Broken

**‚úÖ CONFIRMED WORKING:**
- **Backend Server**: Running on port 8000 with Bun + TypeScript
- **Dragonfly Cache**: Redis-compatible cache working (no password needed)  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL connected with real talent data (2 sample talents)
- **Health Check**: `/api/health` returns proper JSON response
- **Talent API**: `/api/talents` returns real data from database
- **Basic Infrastructure**: Express, middleware stack, error handling

**üî¥ STILL BROKEN/DISABLED:**
- **Conversation Routes**: Disabled due to syntax errors (duplicate exports)
- **Memory Routes**: Disabled - dependencies not checked
- **Batch Routes**: Disabled - dependencies not checked  
- **AI/ML Routes**: Disabled - dependencies not checked
- **OpenAI Agents**: Server startup hanging/failing
- **Frontend Integration**: Not tested with real API calls

**üîÑ PARTIALLY WORKING:**
- **Clerk Auth**: Environment configured but not tested end-to-end
- **Chat Routes**: Exist but not tested (no GET endpoint)
- **WebSocket**: Initialized but not tested

**HONEST ASSESSMENT**: The platform has a working foundation (health + talents) but most advanced features are still disabled due to code issues. It's functional but minimal.

### 2025-09-10 - BRUTAL REALITY CHECK: Feature Inventory Analysis  
- Examined actual codebase vs documentation claims
- Found significant gaps between promises and reality  
- TRUTH: Platform was NOT production ready - but NOW FIXED

### 2025-09-10 - Documentation Rule Implementation
- Established single bible document approach
- Created centralized documentation system
- Rule: All future Claude documentation goes here only
