# CastMatch AI Conversational Navigation Architecture

## Navigation Philosophy
"Talk, Don't Click" - 80% of navigation happens through natural conversation with AI

## Primary Navigation: Conversational Interface

### 1. Natural Language Commands
Users navigate by expressing intent in natural language:

#### Direct Navigation Commands
- "Show me today's auditions"
- "Find actors for the lead role"
- "What's the status of Project Mumbai Dreams?"
- "Show my pending decisions"
- "Take me to Priya's profile"

#### Contextual Navigation
- "Show similar talents" (when viewing a profile)
- "What else do I need to do?" (follows current task)
- "Compare these three actors" (after search)
- "Show the callback list" (during selection)

#### Temporal Navigation
- "What did we discuss yesterday about this role?"
- "Show last week's auditions"
- "What's coming up tomorrow?"
- "Remind me what we decided for this character"

### 2. AI-Guided Navigation

#### Proactive Suggestions
```
AI: "I notice you have 3 auditions scheduled for today. Would you like to:
1. Review the talent profiles
2. See the schedule details
3. Prepare feedback forms"
```

#### Smart Shortcuts
```
AI: "Since you're casting for a romantic lead, you might want to check:
- Top matches from our database
- Recent auditions for similar roles
- Available actors in your preferred age range"
```

#### Context-Aware Prompts
```
AI: "You mentioned budget concerns. Should I show you:
- Talents within your budget range
- Cost comparison for shortlisted actors
- Ways to optimize the casting budget"
```
