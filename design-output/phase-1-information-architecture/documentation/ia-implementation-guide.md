## PART 1: User Flow Requirements from IA

### Core User Flows to Create

#### 1. Talent Discovery Flow
**IA Foundation**: Content Inventory → Talent Profiles + Mental Models → Comparison-Driven Decisions

**Entry Points**:
- Conversation: "Find me a male lead actor"
- Quick Action: Search button
- Project Context: "Cast this role"

**Information Requirements**:
```
Level 1 (Immediate): Search bar, AI suggestions
Level 2 (Quick Access): Filters, recent searches
Level 3 (Progressive): Advanced filters, saved searches
```

**Decision Points**:
1. Initial query → Broad or specific?
2. Results shown → Refine or review?
3. Profile viewed → Shortlist or continue?
4. Comparison needed → Side-by-side or sequential?

**Exit Points**:
- Add to shortlist
- Schedule audition
- Share with team
- Save search

#### 2. Audition Management Flow
**IA Foundation**: Relationships → Project-Audition-Talent + Hierarchy → Time-Sensitive Priority

**Entry Points**:
- Calendar notification
- Conversation: "Schedule auditions for tomorrow"
- Project dashboard: Audition section

**Information Requirements**:
```
Level 1: Today's auditions, urgent conflicts
Level 2: Week view, talent availability
Level 3: Venue details, script materials
```

**Critical Connections**:
- Audition → Talent profiles (must be accessible)
- Audition → Project context (always visible)
- Audition → Team calendar (sync required)
- Audition → Feedback form (immediate post-audition)

#### 3. Decision Making Flow
**IA Foundation**: Mental Models → Collaborative Validation + Navigation → Context-Aware

**Entry Points**:
- Post-audition feedback
- Team discussion in chat
- Deadline trigger

**Information Hierarchy**:
```
Priority 1: Comparison matrix of final candidates
Priority 2: Team opinions and votes
Priority 3: Budget implications
Priority 4: Historical similar decisions
```

**Stakeholder Touchpoints**:
1. Casting Director: Initial recommendation
2. Director: Creative approval
3. Producer: Budget sign-off
4. Channel/Platform: Final confirmation

#### 4. Project Setup Flow
**IA Foundation**: Content Inventory → Projects + Relationships → Dependencies

**Entry Points**:
- "Create new project"
- Template selection
- Import from email

**Progressive Disclosure Sequence**:
```
Step 1: Basic info (title, production house)
Step 2: Timeline and budget
Step 3: Roles and requirements
Step 4: Team assignment
Step 5: Preferences and settings
```

#### 5. Daily Workflow Navigation
**IA Foundation**: Mental Models → Daily Routine + Navigation → Conversational

**Time-Based Entry**:
- Morning: "What's on my plate today?"
- Afternoon: "Show active auditions"
- Evening: "What needs my review?"
- Night: "Tomorrow's preparation"

**Context Switching Requirements**:
- Maintain conversation history
- Preserve project context
- Remember last action
- Suggest next logical step

- Name
- Primary role
- Availability indicator

Layer 2 (Hover/Tap):
- Rate range
- Recent projects
- Languages
- Quick actions

Layer 3 (Expanded):
- Full profile
- Demo reels
- Contact info
- Team notes
```

#### Project Status Widget

```
Critical (Red): Overdue items, blockers
Important (Orange): Today's tasks, pending approvals
Normal (Blue): Progress indicators, upcoming items

if (inAudition) {
  showActions(['Feedback', 'Callback', 'Reject', 'Discuss']);
}
if (makingDecision) {
  showActions(['Approve', 'Request Info', 'Defer', 'Escalate']);
}
```
