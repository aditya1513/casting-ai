## Key IA Principles

### 1. Conversation-First Architecture
- All content must be accessible through natural language
- AI proactively surfaces relevant information
- Context carries across entire conversation
- No dead-ends - always a conversational path forward

### 2. Time-Sensitive Prioritization
- Critical information surfaces automatically
- Urgency indicators on all time-bound content
- Smart scheduling considers Mumbai traffic and festivals
- Real-time updates for dynamic content

### 3. Relationship-Rich Connections
- Every piece of content connects to related items
- Network effects strengthen over time
- AI learns from relationship patterns
- Social/professional connections visible

### 4. Progressive Complexity
- Simple entry points for new users
- Advanced features reveal through usage
- Complexity hidden until needed
- Expert shortcuts available but not required

## Implementation Guidelines

### For User Flow Design
Use this IA to create flows that:
1. **Start with conversation** - Every flow begins with user intent expressed naturally
2. **Respect hierarchy** - Critical information always accessible within 1-2 steps
3. **Follow relationships** - Enable natural movement between related content
4. **Support recovery** - Clear paths back when users get lost

### For Wireframe Creation
This IA informs wireframes by:
1. **Space Allocation** 
   - 60% for primary content (conversations, active work)
   - 25% for contextual information
   - 15% for navigation and system elements

2. **Content Density**
   - Mobile: 1-2 primary content pieces per screen
   - Tablet: 2-3 primary content pieces
   - Desktop: 3-4 primary content pieces with sidebar

3. **Interaction Zones**
   - Conversation interface: Center and prominent
   - Quick actions: Thumb-reachable on mobile
   - Context panels: Edges for desktop, overlays for mobile

### For Design System Development
Components needed based on IA:
1. **Conversation Components**
   - Chat interface with rich responses
   - Voice input/output controls
   - Context indicators
   - Smart suggestions

2. **Content Display Components**
   - Talent cards with progressive disclosure
   - Project summaries with status
   - Timeline/calendar views
   - Comparison tables

3. **Navigation Components**
   - Smart command bar
   - Context breadcrumbs
   - Quick action buttons
   - Slide-out panels

## Mumbai-Specific Adaptations

### Language Considerations
- **Bilingual Support**: Hindi-English mixing in all text areas
- **Regional Tags**: Tamil, Telugu, Marathi for talent profiles
- **Cultural Terms**: Industry-specific jargon preserved

### Location Intelligence
- **Studio Proximity**: Distance calculations from major Mumbai studios
- **Traffic Patterns**: Real-time traffic for scheduling
- **Area Preferences**: Andheri, Bandra, Juhu prominently featured

### Industry Patterns
- **Pilot Season**: January-March heightened activity
- **Festival Breaks**: Automatic calendar adjustments
- **Production Houses**: T-Series, Dharma, YRF relationship tracking

## Success Metrics

### IA Effectiveness Measures
| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
