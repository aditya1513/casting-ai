# Wireframe Design Decisions - Rationale & IA Mapping

## Executive Summary
This document explains the design rationale behind every wireframe decision, mapping each choice back to Information Architecture principles, user flow requirements, and Mumbai casting industry needs. Every layout decision is justified with specific user research and business context.

## Core Design Philosophy Decisions

### 1. Conversation-First Architecture Implementation

#### Decision: 80% Conversational, 20% Traditional UI
**IA Principle:** "Talk, Don't Click" - Natural language as primary interaction

**Wireframe Implementation:**
- Chat interface occupies 60-70% of screen real estate
- Traditional menus relegated to secondary actions
- Voice input button prominently placed in every input context
- Quick action buttons supplement but don't replace conversation

**User Flow Mapping:**
- Project Initiation: Conversational setup instead of form-heavy wizard
- Talent Discovery: Natural language search replaces complex filter interfaces
- Audition Management: Voice scheduling with AI coordination
- Decision Making: Team discussion facilitated through chat interface

### 2. Mobile-First, Mumbai-Context Design
