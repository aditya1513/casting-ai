```

### Phase 2: Individual Stakeholder Input Collection

#### 2A: Director's Creative Perspective
```
AI: "Rajesh, let's start with your creative assessment:
     
     🎬 DIRECTOR'S EVALUATION REQUEST:
     • Which candidate best embodies Priya's character?
     • Performance quality and potential assessment
     • Chemistry with your creative vision
     • Confidence in directing each candidate
     
     Based on auditions, your thoughts?"

DIRECTOR RAJESH: "Radhika completely understood the character. Her 
emotional range is exactly what I need for Priya's journey. Sanya 
is technically good but felt more controlled. Plabita has potential 
but might need more direction."

AI: "Capturing your input:
     ✅ Creative preference: Radhika (strong confidence)
     ⚠️ Concerns about Sanya: Too controlled for character
     💭 Plabita consideration: Potential but needs guidance
     
     Any deal-breaker concerns if budget dictates alternative choice?"

market value. Sanya offers great balance - talented and reasonable 
rate. Plabita is budget-friendly but unknown market risk."

AI: "Recording your assessment:
     📊 Budget analysis: Radhika costs more but justified
     ⚖️ Value preference: Sanya (balance of talent and cost)
     ⚠️ Risk concern: Plabita's market unproven
     
     What's your comfort level with the budget stretch for Radhika?"

     • Platform content strategy alignment
     
     How do these candidates align with your platform vision?"

CHANNEL HEAD: "Our audience loves authentic performers. Radhika 
has great buzz currently. Sanya has loyal indie audience. Fresh 
faces work if content is strong enough."

AI: "Noting market intelligence:
     ✅ Audience trends: Authenticity valued over glamour
     📈 Current buzz: Radhika has momentum
     🎯 Target alignment: All candidates could work with right content
