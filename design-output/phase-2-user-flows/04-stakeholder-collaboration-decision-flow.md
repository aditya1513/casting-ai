```

AI: "Perfect timing! I have complete information ready for decision-making:
     
     üé≠ CANDIDATES EVALUATED:
     ‚Ä¢ Radhika Madan - Top creative choice, higher budget

     ‚Ä¢ Plabita Borthakur - Fresh face, budget-friendly
     
     üë• DECISION MAKERS TO COORDINATE:
     ‚Ä¢ You (Casting Director) - Creative expertise
     ‚Ä¢ Rajesh (Director) - Creative vision holder
     ‚Ä¢ Meera (Producer) - Budget and schedule authority

```

#### 1B: Decision Framework Establishment
```
AI: "Setting up structured decision framework:
     
     üìä DECISION CRITERIA (Weighted):
     ‚Ä¢ Creative Fit (40%) - Director's primary domain
     ‚Ä¢ Budget Impact (25%) - Producer's primary concern
     ‚Ä¢ Market Appeal (20%) - Channel's priority
     ‚Ä¢ Schedule Compatibility (15%) - Production requirement
     
     üéØ SUCCESS DEFINITION:
     ‚Ä¢ Unanimous agreement preferred
     ‚Ä¢ Director has creative veto power
     ‚Ä¢ Producer has budget veto power
     ‚Ä¢ Channel has final market approval

     2. Comparative analysis presentation
     3. Open discussion facilitation
     4. Consensus building or escalation
     
     Ready to begin stakeholder consultation?"
```

### Phase 2: Individual Stakeholder Input Collection

#### 2A: Director's Creative Perspective
```
AI: "Rajesh, let's start with your creative assessment:
     
     üé¨ DIRECTOR'S EVALUATION REQUEST:
     ‚Ä¢ Which candidate best embodies Priya's character?
     ‚Ä¢ Performance quality and potential assessment
     ‚Ä¢ Chemistry with your creative vision
     ‚Ä¢ Confidence in directing each candidate
     
     Based on auditions, your thoughts?"

DIRECTOR RAJESH: "Radhika completely understood the character. Her 
emotional range is exactly what I need for Priya's journey. Sanya 
is technically good but felt more controlled. Plabita has potential 
but might need more direction."

AI: "Capturing your input:
     ‚úÖ Creative preference: Radhika (strong confidence)
     ‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns about Sanya: Too controlled for character
     üí≠ Plabita consideration: Potential but needs guidance
     
     Any deal-breaker concerns if budget dictates alternative choice?"
```

#### 2B: Producer's Business Perspective  
```
AI: "Meera, let's get your production perspective:
     
     üí∞ PRODUCER'S EVALUATION AREAS:
     ‚Ä¢ Budget impact and value for money
     ‚Ä¢ Schedule reliability and professionalism
     ‚Ä¢ Market positioning and audience appeal
     ‚Ä¢ Risk assessment for project success
     
     Your analysis based on the options?"

PRODUCER MEERA: "Radhika is 40% more expensive but brings proven 
market value. Sanya offers great balance - talented and reasonable 
rate. Plabita is budget-friendly but unknown market risk."

AI: "Recording your assessment:
     üìä Budget analysis: Radhika costs more but justified
     ‚öñÔ∏è Value preference: Sanya (balance of talent and cost)
     ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk concern: Plabita's market unproven
     
     What's your comfort level with the budget stretch for Radhika?"
```

#### 2C: Channel Head's Market Perspective
```

     ‚Ä¢ Social media and promotional potential
     ‚Ä¢ Competition analysis and differentiation
     ‚Ä¢ Platform content strategy alignment
     
     How do these candidates align with your platform vision?"

CHANNEL HEAD: "Our audience loves authentic performers. Radhika 
has great buzz currently. Sanya has loyal indie audience. Fresh 
faces work if content is strong enough."

AI: "Noting market intelligence:
     ‚úÖ Audience trends: Authenticity valued over glamour
     üìà Current buzz: Radhika has momentum
     üéØ Target alignment: All candidates could work with right content
     ‚ùì Promotional consideration: Established vs fresh face trade-off
