4. **Voice Initiation**: "CastMatch, let's begin a new project"

## Core Conversation Flow

### Phase 1: Project Context Discovery
**AI Initial Response**: "Let's start your new project! What are we casting today?"

#### 1A: Natural Project Description
```
User: "It's a romantic drama web series set in Mumbai"
AI: "Exciting! I'm creating 'Mumbai Romance Series' as your project name. 
     Tell me more - what's the story about and who's your target audience?"

User: "It's about a young couple navigating love in the startup world"
AI: "Perfect context! I'm noting 'startup romance' theme. 
     Do you have a script ready, or should we start with character outlines?"
```

#### 1B: Script Upload Conversation
```
User: [Uploads script file] "Analyze this for me"
AI: "I see you've uploaded 'Mumbai_Dreams_Episode1.pdf' - 45 pages.
     Let me read through this... 
     
     [After 3 seconds]
     
     I've identified 8 speaking roles and 3 main characters. 
     The story revolves around Arjun (28M, tech entrepreneur) and 
     Priya (26F, marketing professional). Should I break down all the roles?"
```

### Phase 2: Script Intelligence Analysis
**AI Proactive Analysis**: Automatically extracts character details, dialogue patterns, and casting requirements

#### 2A: Character Role Breakdown
```
AI: "From your script, I've found these key roles:

MAIN CHARACTERS:
• Arjun (Male, 26-30) - Lead role, 40% screen time
  Tech-savvy, ambitious, speaks Hindi-English mix
• Priya (Female, 24-28) - Lead role, 35% screen time  
  Creative, independent, strong Marathi background
• Rohit (Male, 30-35) - Supporting, 15% screen time
  Mentor figure, corporate experience needed

SUPPORTING CAST:
• 3 friends (mixed gender, 20-28 years)
• 2 parents (50+ years, traditional values)

Should I create detailed casting briefs for each role?"
```

#### 2B: Scene & Location Analysis
```
AI: "I notice 60% of scenes are office/cafe settings, 30% home interiors.
     This suggests we need actors comfortable with:
     - Contemporary urban dialogue
     - Corporate/startup environments  
     - Natural chemistry for intimate scenes
     
     The script has significant Hindi-English code-switching.
     Should I prioritize bilingual actors?"
```

### Phase 3: Project Configuration Through Conversation

#### 3A: Budget & Timeline Discussion
```
User: "We have 2 crores budget and need to wrap by March"
AI: "Got it - ₹2 crore budget with March deadline. 
     That gives us 4 months for casting and pre-production.
     
     For this budget range, I'm suggesting:
     • Established TV actors for leads (₹2-5 lakhs/episode)
     • Fresh faces for supporting roles (₹20-50k/episode)
     • 2-week intensive audition process
     
     Does this align with your producer's expectations?"
```

#### 3B: Creative Direction Conversation
```
User: "The director wants raw, realistic performances"
AI: "Perfect - I'm noting 'naturalistic performance style' as key criteria.
     This suggests theater-trained actors or method actors.
     
     Should I prioritize:
     - Actors with indie film background?
     - Theater experience over commercial work?
     - Newcomers over established faces?
     
     I can also search for actors who've worked in similar realistic dramas."
```

### Phase 4: Team Setup & Collaboration

#### 4A: Stakeholder Definition
```
AI: "Who else will be involved in casting decisions?
     I need to set up the approval workflow."

User: "The director Rajesh, producer Meera, and channel head will have final say"
AI: "Adding decision makers:
     • Rajesh (Director) - Creative approval needed
     • Meera (Producer) - Budget & schedule approval  
     • Channel Head - Final cast approval
     
     Should I set up WhatsApp notifications for the team?"
```

#### 4B: Assistant & Support Team
```
AI: "Do you have assistant directors or casting associates helping?
     I can give them limited access to shortlists and scheduling."

User: "Yes, Kavya will help with initial screening"
AI: "Adding Kavya as Casting Associate with permissions for:
     • Viewing all talent submissions
     • Creating initial shortlists
     • Scheduling auditions
     • Cannot make final decisions
     
     I'll send her an invite link."
```

### Phase 5: AI-Powered Project Intelligence

#### 5A: Market Research Integration
```
AI: "I've analyzed similar successful shows:
     • Sacred Games casting approach
     • Mumbai Diaries ensemble strategy
     • Rocket Boys fresh face selection
     
     Based on this, shall I prioritize:
     - 60% established actors, 40% fresh talent?
     - Focus on authentic Mumbai actors?
     - Include South Indian actors for pan-India appeal?"
```

#### 5B: Predictive Casting Suggestions
```
AI: "Based on your script analysis, I'm already seeing potential matches:
     
     FOR ARJUN (Lead Male):
     • Vicky Kaushal type (if budget allows)
     • Emerging actors from similar web series
     • Theater actors with tech-savvy image
     
     Should I prepare a preliminary list while we finalize other details?"
```

### Phase 6: Project Launch & Next Steps

#### 6A: Project Dashboard Creation
```
AI: "Your project 'Mumbai Dreams' is now set up! Here's what I've created:

     PROJECT OVERVIEW:
     • 8 roles defined with detailed briefs

```

     ✓ Google Calendar with audition slots
     ✓ Shared folder for scripts and references
     ✓ Budget tracker with role-wise allocation
     ✓ Talent pipeline for each character
