# CastMatch Design System Architecture

## Overview

This design system is built on systematic design principles observed from modern AI platforms like Helixa, adapted specifically for CastMatch's entertainment industry focus.

## Core Architecture Principles

### 1. Token-Based Architecture
- **Three-tier token system**: Primitive → Semantic → Component
- **Single source of truth** for all design decisions
- **Platform-agnostic** tokens that can be consumed by any framework

### 2. Component Composition
- **Atomic design methodology**: Atoms → Molecules → Organisms
- **Compound component pattern** for complex UIs
- **Prop-driven variants** for flexibility

### 3. Dark-First Design
- **Elevation-based surface hierarchy** instead of color variations
- **Reduced eye strain** for long working sessions
- **Professional aesthetic** aligned with creative industries

## Token System

### Primitive Tokens
Located in `/tokens/primitive/`:
- `colors.json` - Base color palette
- `typography.json` - Font families, sizes, weights
- `spacing.json` - Spacing scale and grid system
- `motion.json` - Animation durations and easings
- `breakpoints.json` - Responsive breakpoints

### Semantic Tokens
Located in `/tokens/semantic/`:
- `theme-dark.json` - Dark theme semantic mappings
- `theme-light.json` - Light theme semantic mappings (optional)

### Component Tokens
Located in `/tokens/component/`:
- Component-specific design tokens
- Override patterns for special cases

## Component Library

### Foundation Components
- **Card**: Container with elevation variants
- **Button**: Interactive element with multiple states
- **Typography**: Text components with semantic styles

### Data Display
- **StatCard**: Metrics and KPI display
- **TalentCard**: Talent profile cards
- **ChartCard**: Data visualization containers

### Layout Components
- **Grid**: Responsive grid system
- **Container**: Constrained width wrapper
- **Stack**: Vertical/horizontal spacing utility

## Implementation Guidelines

### State Management
Every interactive component implements:
1. Default state
2. Hover state
3. Active/pressed state
4. Focus state (keyboard navigation)
5. Disabled state
6. Loading state (where applicable)

### Accessibility Standards
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum
- Focus visible indicators
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Reduced motion support

### Performance Targets
- Component render: <50ms
- Animation FPS: 60fps minimum
- Bundle size: <100kb for core system
- CSS specificity: Maximum 3 levels

## Design Patterns

### Elevation System
```
Level 0: Background (base)
Level 1: Cards, raised surfaces
Level 2: Dropdowns, tooltips
Level 3: Modals, overlays
Level 4: Notifications, toasts
Level 5: Critical dialogs
```

### Color Application
```
Primary Actions: Blue-500 (#3B82F6)
Secondary Actions: Cyan-500 (#06B6D4)
Destructive: Red-600
Success: Green-600
Warning: Yellow-600
```

### Spacing Rhythm
```
Base unit: 4px
Common spacing: 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64
Container padding: 16px (mobile) → 48px (desktop)
```

## Responsive Strategy

### Breakpoints
- xs: 0px (base)
- sm: 640px (large phone)
- md: 768px (tablet)
- lg: 1024px (desktop)
- xl: 1280px (wide desktop)
- 2xl: 1536px (ultra-wide)

### Grid System
- Mobile: 4 columns
- Tablet: 8 columns
- Desktop: 12 columns
- Wide: 16 columns

## Motion Design

### Animation Principles
1. **Purpose**: Every animation has a clear purpose
2. **Performance**: 60fps minimum, GPU-accelerated
3. **Consistency**: Shared timing and easing functions
4. **Accessibility**: Respect prefers-reduced-motion

### Standard Transitions
- Fast: 150ms (micro-interactions)
- Normal: 250ms (standard transitions)
- Slow: 350ms (complex animations)

## Integration with CastMatch
