# CastMatch Chat UI Vision Document
**Chief Design Officer Deliverable**
*Created: 2025-09-04*

## EXECUTIVE VISION STATEMENT

CastMatch's chat interface will revolutionize casting conversations by combining the intimacy of personal messaging with the power of AI-driven talent discovery. Our interface transcends traditional chat UX by seamlessly blending conversational flows with rich talent presentation, creating an immersive Mumbai cinema-inspired experience.

## 3 CORE PRINCIPLES FOR CONVERSATIONAL UX IN CASTING CONTEXT

### 1. **CONTEXTUAL TALENT IMMERSION**
Chat messages become windows into talent portfolios. When discussing an actor, their headshot, reel clips, and key stats appear contextually within the conversation thread, eliminating the need to leave the chat flow.

**Implementation Standards:**
- Rich talent cards embedded inline with messages
- Hover states reveal expanded talent information
- Seamless media playback without disrupting conversation
- Progressive disclosure: basic info → detailed portfolio → full profile

### 2. **WORKFLOW-AWARE CONVERSATION DESIGN**
The interface adapts to casting workflow stages (discovery → review → scheduling → decision), providing contextual tools and information architecture that supports each phase.

**Implementation Standards:**
- Dynamic sidebar tools based on conversation context
- Smart suggestions for next actions (schedule audition, share with team)
- Workflow progress indicators integrated into chat header
- Context-switching between multiple casting projects

### 3. **CINEMATIC IMMERSION WITH MUMBAI AESTHETIC**
Every interaction reflects the glamour and professionalism of Mumbai's film industry, using dark themes, gold accents, and sophisticated typography that makes users feel part of Bollywood's creative process.

**Implementation Standards:**
- Mumbai cinema-inspired dark theme (deep blacks, warm golds)
- Typography that reflects film industry sophistication
- Subtle animation that feels cinematic, not distracting
- Cultural color psychology: gold for success, deep blues for trust
